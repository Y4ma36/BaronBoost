          <p>
            "The Purge" is an event during which Baron Boost will wipe customer
            data for security purposes and to maintain low database costs. This
            helps keep boosting costs low for customers and ensures a high
            payout rate for boosters. Prior to the Purge, the Website will close
            temporarily to stop any incoming orders, allowing us to complete all
            existing orders. This event will not affect customer orders or
            booster payouts.
